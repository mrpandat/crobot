# Crobot

Crobot is a Slack bot user. It is designed to maintain a list of users that have to bring breakfast to the office.

In France :fr:, the breakfast is composed of **cro**issant, hence the **Cro**bot name.

## Crobot's purpose

Every people working in an open space knows one thing: **DO NOT LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER UNLOCKED**. If someone leaves its computer unlocked, one of his coworker will most likely go to his computer and do stupid things assuming his identity.

One of these stupid things is to tell other people that he will bring the breakfast for everybody in the near future.

We can say that...

> He just got croissanted :sunglasses:

The *croissanted* person will most likely deny the fact that he was *croissanted* for several reasons:

- > I was just looking for a document in the next office, I didn't need to lock my computer

- > I was speaking to John and didn't pay attention to my computer, but it's not valid because I was really close to my computer

Enough with these bad excuses. If you've been *croissanted*, it's your fault, you have to be more careful. Just remember that it could have been worse.

Crobot is there to make sure that there is no possible denial of *croissantage*. Once you're in the Crobot's list, the only way to be removed is to bring croissants to everyone.

## How does it work

### Get on the Crobot's list

To get on the Crobot's list, the only thing to do is to ping it with the keyword `croissant`.

> @crobot I will bring croissants next time

Simple as that. So if you want someone to bring the croissants, just type in this command on one of your coworker's Slack.

This command will output how many times the *croissanted* user have to bring breakfast.

> Looks like `<user>` needs to bring breakfast `<count>` times!

## Next things to do
- Add the possibility to get the croissanted list
- Find an easy way to tell Crobot that someone paid one of his debts
- Add the possibility for someone to get blacklisted with associated documentation
- Add an help command to explain how Crobot works
- Think of any other functionalities to add
